# **Working_With_VBA**

## **Overview of Project**

In this challenge we are presenting stock summary data that will help decide which green stocks are best for investment this year. The challenge also involved refactoring the code that we built throughout the module.

## **Results**

In our analysis, we are using stock's returns to determine if a stock is worth investment. 

**We could draw following conclusions based on the stock's annual return**

1. Return shows the percentage change in stock price over a period. 
    For year 2017, DQ and SEDG stand out with higher returns.
    For year 2018, ENPH and RUN stand out with higher returns.    

2. Here are the run times for 2017 and 2018:
